 Files in this repository:

 - README.md - file you are reading, explains all the necessary information about the files in this project.

 - Codebook.md - file discribing all the data, variables and transformations.

 - run_analysis.R - R file containing the code that loads all the data and generates a tidy data set as follows:

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 Other libraries used in run_analysis - dplyr.

 For a description of the variables see the Codebook.
